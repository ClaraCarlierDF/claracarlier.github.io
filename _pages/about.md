## About me

I'm currently a PhD student on an industrial contract. It's a collaboration between the [CREST-ENSAE](https://crest.science/) laboratory at the *Institut Polytechnique de Paris* and the [Technocentre](https://www.renaultgroup.com/groupe/implantations/technocentre/), Renault's largest innovation and development center. I'm supervised by [Matthieu Lerasle](http://lerasle.perso.math.cnrs.fr/index.html) and Arnaud Franju. I'm working on the *calibration of models to build the digital twin of the autonomous vehicle*. My work revolves around various methods such as *supervised learning and classification*, as well as *Bayesian inference* using *Approximate Bayesian Computation methods*. For more details, see **CV** section.
